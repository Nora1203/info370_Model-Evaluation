# Model-Evaluation
The dataset compas-score-data, is based off ProPublicas dataset, compiled from public records in Florida.
## Objectives:
1. Use confusion matrices to understand a recent controversy around racial equality and criminal justice system.
  
2. Use logistic regression skills to develop and validate a model, analogous to the proprietary COMPAS model that caused the above-mentioned controversy.
  
3. Hands-on experience with typical machine learning workflow, in particular
model selection with cross-validation.

4. Think over the concept of fairness, and the role of statistical tools in the policymaking process.
